## Exercises (required)

### The story {-}

Though far from a perfect assessment of academic preparedness, SAT scores have historically been used as one measurement of a state's education system. The `education` dataset contains various education variables for each state:

```{r}
# Import and check out data
education <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/sat.csv")
head(education)
```

A codebook is provided by Danny Kaplan who also made these data accessible:

### Exercise 1: SAT scores {-}

#### Part a {-}

Construct a plot of how the average `sat` scores vary from state to state. (Just use 1 variable -- `sat` not `State`!)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(education, aes(x=sat))+
  geom_density()

```

#### Part b {-}

Summarize your observations from the plot. Comment on the basics: range, typical outcomes, shape. (Any theories about what might explain this non-normal shape?)

the SAT scores range from about 840 - 1200 the shape of the plot is slightly skewed right possibly this shape is because there are averages in two specific spots rather than incremental increases in scores. (people either do bad, good, or fantastic)

### Exercise 2: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending & SAT Scores vs Salaries {-}

The first question we'd like to answer is: Can the variability in `sat` scores from state to state be partially explained by how much a state spends on education, specifically its per pupil spending (`expend`) and typical teacher `salary`?

#### Part a {-}

```{r}
# Construct a plot of sat vs expend
ggplot(education, aes(y=sat,x=expend))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm")+ geom_point()
# Include a "best fit linear regression model" (HINT: method = "lm")

```

```{r}
# Construct a plot of sat vs salary
# Include a "best fit linear regression model" (HINT: method = "lm")

ggplot(education,aes(y=sat,x=salary))+geom_smooth(method="lm")+geom_point()

```

#### Part b {-}

What are the relationship trends between SAT scores and spending? Is there anything that surprises you?

I'm surpised that the on the right-hand side where salary is higher the SAT score drop/ are lower than the middle region where teachers are paid less. I would assume the more money teachers are getting the more drive they have to prepare their students for the SAT. 


### Exercise 3: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending *and* Teacher Salaries {-}

Construct *one* visualization of the relationship of `sat` with `salary` *and* `expend`. HINT: Start with just 2 variables and tweak that code to add the third variable. Try out a few things!

```{r}
ggplot(education,aes(y=sat,x=salary,color=expend))+geom_smooth(method="lm")+geom_point()
```


### Exercise 4: Another way to Incorporate Scale {-}

It can be tough to distinguish color scales and size scales for quantitative variables. Another option is to *discretize* a quantitative variable, or basically cut it up into *categories*.

Construct the plot below. Check out the code and think about what's happening here. What happens if you change "2" to "3"?

breaks it up into 3 cuts rather than 2 and so on (CREATES RANGES)

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = cut(expend, 3))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm")
```

Describe the trivariate relationship between `sat`, `salary`, and `expend`.

as expend and salary increase the SAT scores decrease. 

### Exercise 5: Finally an Explanation {-}

It's strange that SAT scores *seem* to decrease with spending. But we're leaving out an important variable from our analysis: the fraction of a state's students that actually take the SAT. The `fracCat` variable indicates this fraction: `low` (under 15% take the SAT), `medium` (15-45% take the SAT), and `high` (at least 45% take the SAT).

#### Part a {-}

Build a univariate viz of `fracCat` to better understand how many states fall into each category.

```{r}
ggplot(education, aes(x = fracCat))+geom_bar()

```

#### Part b {-}

Build 2 bivariate visualizations that demonstrate the relationship between `sat` and `fracCat`. What story does your graphic tell and why does this make contextual sense?

More students taking it = lower scores (probably because where there are less students are the ones who are confident and study more)

```{r}
ggplot(education,aes(fill=fracCat,x=sat))+geom_density(alpha=0.5)
ggplot(education,aes(x=fracCat,y=sat))+geom_point()
```

#### Part c {-}

Make a trivariate visualization that demonstrates the relationship of `sat` with `expend` AND `fracCat`. Highlight the differences in `fracCat` groups through color AND unique trend lines. What story does your graphic tell?\
Does it still seem that SAT scores decrease as spending increases?
 
 no in this case SAT scores are increasing with spending 
 
 
```{r}
ggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = expend, color = fracCat)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")

```

#### Part d {-}

Putting all of this together, explain this example of **Simpsonâ€™s Paradox**. That is, why did it appear that SAT scores decrease as spending increases even though the *opposite* is true?

It appeared that way because the less money spent on spending the less kids who think they have a chance to do well so less participation so only the best kids participate increasing the low expend areas score values.
