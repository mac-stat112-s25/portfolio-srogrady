# Best Quadvariate Viz {-}


Use this file to generate a professional looking **quadvariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}

library(mosaic)
library(lubridate)
data("Birthdays")

daily_births <- Birthdays |>
  group_by(date) |>
    summarize(total = sum(births))

daily_births <- daily_births |>
  mutate(week_day = wday(date,label = TRUE)) |> 
  mutate(month_day = mday(date)) |> 
  mutate(year = year(date))
  

holidays <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/US-Holidays.csv") |>
  mutate(date = as.POSIXct(lubridate::dmy(date)))

```

```{r}
# Define daily_births_1980
daily_births_1980 <- daily_births |>
  filter(year == 1980) |>
  left_join(holidays, by = "date") |>
  mutate(is_holiday = !is.na(holiday))

```


```{r}
daily_births_1980 |>
  ggplot(aes(y=total, x = date, color = week_day, shape = is_holiday))+
    geom_point()+
  theme_classic()+
  labs(title = "Babies Born in 1980", y = "Total Number of Babies Born", x = "Month", caption = "Made by Shaylee (4/25)")
fig.alt = "dot plot representing the total number of babies born (y-axis) per day (x-axis) in 1980. Color each date according to its day of the week, and shape each date according to whether or not itâ€™s a holiday.."
```
