# Best Univariate Viz {-}

Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
#| eval: true
library(ggplot2)
# Import data
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")
```


```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 50) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes", title = "Looking at Number of Hikes at different Elevations", caption = "Made by Shaylee (4/25)")
fig.alt = "Histogram with x-axis showing ranges of hike elevations ranging from 3820-5344"
```
