Use this file to generate a professional looking **spatial** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.


```{r}
#| eval: true
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(leaflet)
# Import starbucks location data
starbucks <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/starbucks.csv")

starbucks_mn <- starbucks |>   
  filter(Country == "US", State.Province == "MN")
```


```{r}

leaflet(data = starbucks_mn) |> 
  addTiles() |> 
  addCircleMarkers(color ="red", lng = ~Longitude, lat = ~Latitude)
